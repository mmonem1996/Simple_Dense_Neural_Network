# Simple Dense Neural Network
This repository contains a simple structure of a NN to illustrate the mechanism of Backpropagation.

This algorithm is a more general build based on backpropagation model provided by: https://github.com/AdityaGupta030697/Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Backpropagation.ipynb
